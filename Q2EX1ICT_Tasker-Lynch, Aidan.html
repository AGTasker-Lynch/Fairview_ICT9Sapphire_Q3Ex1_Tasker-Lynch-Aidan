                <p>One of the four playable Survivors in Left 4 Dead 2 is Nicolas, also known as Nick. He's a gambler with a dubious—even violent—history. He is hesitant to join the group at all and adopts the persona of "the complainer," criticizing the plans of others, the deteriorating condition of his once-fine suit, and the shortcomings of his fellow members. Because of this, he is initially hard for the others to get along with, but with time, as he gains their trust and establishes himself as an important member of the team, this changes.  </p>
